# CS-230 - SOFTWARE DESIGN DOCUMENT

# The Client:
The Gaming Room is a hypothetical game developer. The company had an Android-based game application called Draw It or Lose It. To improve customer accessibility, The Gaming Room wished to develop a web-based version of the Android app. The web-based version was to serve multiple platforms including traditional desktop operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS) using popular browsers, as well as iOS.

# What I did well in this documentation:
I believe I did a great job at justifying my recommendation of the server operating system. I did a good job illustrating the reasons a Linux server is more stable than a Windows server.

# What about the process of working through a design document did I find helpful when developing the code?
Having a UML diagram illustrated for me as I develop code gives me a better holistic view of the design. Being able to reference the UML diagram makes it easier to develop more efficiently.

# What would I revise in this design document?
I realize that the executive summary in design documents do not have to be extensively detailed. It is meant to be a high level overview rather than a place for technology specifics. I would trim some of the framework and library specifics in this particular design document.

# How did I interpret user's needs?

Some of the requirements were easy to implement into the design of the software, while others were required some critical thinking. The game needed the ability to have one or more teams involved, so a client-server architecture was obvious. A user on the Android or iOS platform should be able to play with a user on a desktop browser. In addition, the app needed to be responsive in a time-based game format. For these reasons, a RESTful API was recommended. It’s important to consider the user’s requirements/needs during the designing process so the product is delivered with the most value.

# How did I approach designing software?

My approach is to reference the user requirements (or user stories) as often as possible, to remind myself of what is needed throughout the software design. In an enterprise setting, I would want to communicate with the product owner and customer as much as possible throughout the software development life cycle.
